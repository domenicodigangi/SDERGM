This repository is still a work in progress and can contain bugs.

For a simple application of the SD beta model discussed in the paper start from simulationsAndPlotsPaper/beta_model/SD_Beta_model_example.jl

The data used for the empirical application regarding the eMid financial network is not publicaly available, hence not included here.
